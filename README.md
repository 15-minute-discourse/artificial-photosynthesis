## Artificial Photosynthesis: Principles, Processes, and Possibilities

Artificial photosynthesis is a chemical process that mimics natural photosynthesis, with the goal of capturing and storing energy from sunlight by producing a fuel, specifically a solar fuel \[1\]. It is considered a vital process that could be the foundation of a world that would no longer need fossil fuels \[2\].

\*\*Differences between Artificial and Natural Photosynthesis:\*\*While both natural and artificial photosynthesis harness sunlight, they differ significantly in their implementation and efficiency \[3\]. Natural photosynthesis is highly optimized through billions of years of evolution, achieving an efficiency of around 3‚Äì6% in converting sunlight into stored chemical energy \[3\]. In contrast, artificial systems currently struggle to achieve similar efficiencies at a comparable cost \[3\]. However, artificial photosynthesis holds the promise of producing energy-dense fuels, unlike natural photosynthesis, which primarily produces glucose \[3\].

Here is a table comparing natural and artificial photosynthesis \[4\]:

\*\*Core Principles:\*\*The core principle of artificial photosynthesis is to use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to produce fuels and chemicals \[5\]. Ideally, the only byproduct would be oxygen \[5\]. The process involves several key steps \[6\]:

‚Ä¢ Light Harvesting: Light-harvesting complexes capture photons and transduce them into electrons \[6\]. In photochemical cells, the process begins with the absorption of light by a photosensitizer, a light-absorbing material that generates excited electrons upon illumination \[7\]. The photosensitizer can be organic dye, inorganic dye, or a quantum dot, each with their unique light absorption characteristics \[7\].

‚Ä¢ Charge Separation: Proton-coupled electron transfer along several cofactors of the photosynthetic chain, causing local, spatial charge separation \[6\]. Upon light absorption, the excited electrons are transferred from the photosensitizer to a suitable electron acceptor while the holes (h+; positive charges) are transferred to an electron donor \[8\]. This charge separation process is essential for converting the absorbed light energy into chemical energy and avoiding the rapid recombination of generated charges, which would result in energy loss \[8\].

‚Ä¢ Redox Catalysis: Redox catalysis uses the transferred electrons to oxidize water to dioxygen and protons; these protons can in some species be utilized for dihydrogen production \[6\]. The separated charges drive two critical reactions in artificial photosynthesis: water oxidation and carbon dioxide reduction \[9\]. In water oxidation, also known as the oxygen-evolving reaction (OER), the holes generated during the charge separation process oxidize water molecules to produce oxygen gas and protons \[9\]. In carbon dioxide reduction, also known as the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), excited electrons reduce CO2 to produce value-added chemicals and fuels, such as carbon monoxide, formic acid, methanol, or methane \[9\].

A triad assembly, with a photosensitizer (P) linked in tandem to a water oxidation catalyst (D) and a hydrogen evolving catalyst (A), could replicate these processes \[1, 6\]. Electrons would flow from D to A when catalysis occurs \[1\].

## Artificial Photosynthesis: A Sustainable Energy Solution

Artificial photosynthesis is considered a potential game-changer for the future of energy because it offers a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels by producing fuels and chemicals from carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight \[1, 2\]. It has the potential to address climate change and energy security challenges \[3\].

Here's a detailed breakdown:

‚Ä¢ Replacing Fossil Fuels: Artificial photosynthesis (AP) has the potential to replace the use of fossil fuels \[1\]. It is a vital process that could form the foundation of a world that no longer needs fossil fuels \[1\].

‚Ä¢ Production of Useful Fuels: AP can convert carbon dioxide into methanol, which is a useful liquid fuel that can power cars, heat homes, or generate electricity in fuel cells \[4\]. It can also produce hydrogen or other solar fuels \[5, 6\].

‚Ä¢ Mimicking Natural Photosynthesis: AP mimics the natural photosynthetic process, converting solar energy into chemical energy that is stored in organic compounds \[7\]. It aims to create an efficient, clean, and cost-effective way to convert sunlight into storable energy forms \[5\].

‚Ä¢ Potential for Sustainable Solution: AP has the potential to be a sustainable solution for energy needs, addressing the challenges of climate change and energy security \[3\].

‚Ä¢ Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions: These technologies have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to a more sustainable energy future \[8\].

‚Ä¢ Carbon-Neutral Energy Source: Artificially photosynthesized fuel would be a carbon-neutral source of energy \[2\].

‚Ä¢ Versatile Applications: The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to chemicals is viewed as a sustainable method to combat global warming while promoting economic benefits \[9\].

‚Ä¢ Mimicking the Calvin Cycle: Researchers are developing catalytic systems to reduce CO2 into usable fuels and valuable chemicals by mimicking the natural Calvin cycle \[10\].

‚Ä¢ Addressing Limitations of Natural Photosynthesis: Natural photosynthesis is optimized through billions of years of evolution, achieving an efficiency of around 3‚Äì6% in converting sunlight into stored chemical energy \[3\]. Artificial systems currently struggle to achieve similar efficiencies at a comparable cost \[3\]. However, artificial photosynthesis holds the promise of producing energy-dense fuels, unlike natural photosynthesis, which primarily produces glucose \[3\].

Despite these promises, there are challenges:

‚Ä¢ Scalability: Scaling up laboratory-scale systems to a large scale remains a significant hurdle \[11, 12\].

‚Ä¢ Durability and Stability: Many materials and components used in these systems can degrade over time \[13, 14\].

‚Ä¢ Cost and Resource Efficiency: Many materials and processes currently used in photochemical cells, such as noble metal catalysts and complex fabrication techniques, can be expensive and resource intensive \[15\].

## Artificial Photosynthesis: History and Development

The idea of artificial photosynthesis was first anticipated in 1912 by Italian chemist Giacomo Ciamician \[1\]. In a lecture published in Science, Ciamician proposed a shift from using fossil fuels to radiant energy from the sun, captured by technical photochemistry devices \[1, 2\]. He envisioned this switch as a way to reduce the disparity between the wealthy north and the poorer south of Europe, suggesting that the move from coal to solar energy would benefit progress and human happiness \[1\].

Akira Fujishima later discovered the photocatalytic properties of titanium dioxide in the late 1960s; this is known as the Honda-Fujishima effect, and it can be used for hydrolysis \[3\].

William Ayers at Energy Conversion Devices demonstrated visible light water splitting using a one-piece multijunction semiconductor device in 1983 \[3\]. This group demonstrated water photolysis into hydrogen and oxygen using a low-cost, thin-film amorphous silicon multijunction sheet immersed directly in water; this is now referred to as an "artificial leaf" \[3\]. Hydrogen evolved on the front amorphous silicon surface, which was decorated with various catalysts, while oxygen evolved from the back side metal substrate, which also eliminated the hazard of mixed hydrogen/oxygen gas evolution \[3\]. A polymer membrane above the immersed device provided a path for proton transport \[3\]. The higher photovoltage available from the multijunction thin film device with visible light was a major advance over previous photolysis attempts with UV or other single junction semiconductor photoelectrodes \[3\]. The group's patent also lists several other semiconductor multijunction compositions in addition to amorphous silicon \[3\].

## Artificial Photosynthesis: Inputs, Outputs, and Processes

The primary inputs for artificial photosynthesis are water, carbon dioxide, and sunlight \[1\]. The desired outputs are fuels, such as hydrogen, carbon monoxide, formic acid, methanol, methane, or other energy-rich chemical feedstocks like ethylene, and value-added chemicals \[2-5\]. Ideally, the only byproduct of artificial photosynthesis would be oxygen \[1\].

Detailed Elaboration

1. Inputs:

‚ó¶ Water (H2O): Water is a crucial input in both natural and artificial photosynthesis, often serving as a source of protons and electrons for the process \[6\]. In photochemical cells, water is used for proton/electron source \[6\]. Water splitting is a key process in artificial photosynthesis, where water molecules are split into hydrogen and oxygen using sunlight \[7, 8\]. The overall reaction for water splitting is: 2H2O + photons ‚Üí 2H2 + O2 \[8\].

‚ó¶ Carbon Dioxide (CO2): Carbon dioxide is another essential input, particularly for the production of carbon-based fuels and chemicals \[5, 9\]. The goal is to develop systems that mimic nature by reducing atmospheric CO2 levels and utilizing the carbon in the synthesis of high-value compounds \[10\]. Light-driven carbon dioxide reduction involves converting water and carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide or organic compounds and oxygen \[5\].

‚ó¶ Sunlight: Sunlight provides the energy needed to drive the artificial photosynthesis process \[9, 11\]. Photoelectrochemical cells directly convert solar energy into chemical energy \[12\]. The process begins with the absorption of light by a photosensitizer, which generates excited electrons upon illumination \[13, 14\]. Broadening the absorption spectra of photochemical cells allows them to capture more sunlight and convert it into useful energy \[15\].

2. Outputs:

‚ó¶ Hydrogen (H2): Hydrogen gas is one of the primary desired products, as it can be used as a clean fuel \[3\]. Artificial photosynthesis attempts to mimic natural processes to create an efficient, clean, and cost-effective way to convert sunlight into storable energy forms, mainly hydrogen or other solar fuels \[2\]. Water splitting, facilitated by photochemical cells, is essential for producing hydrogen fuel using renewable energy sources \[7, 8\].

‚ó¶ Carbon Monoxide (CO): In the conceptually simplest manifestation of light-driven carbon dioxide reduction, carbon monoxide is produced as an output \[5\].

‚ó¶ Formic Acid (HCO2H): Formic acid can be produced from water and carbon dioxide through artificial photosynthesis \[5\].

‚ó¶ Methanol (CH3OH): Methanol is another valuable output that can be used for hydrogen storage and in the production of gasoline and biodiesel \[4, 16\]. It can also power cars, heat homes or generate electricity in fuel cells.

‚ó¶ Methane (CH4): Methane is one of the potential value-added chemicals and fuels that can be produced through carbon dioxide reduction \[3\].

‚ó¶ Ethylene (C2H4): Ethylene, an energy-rich chemical feedstock, is useful for a range of applications \[16, 17\].

‚ó¶ Oxygen (O2): Oxygen is a byproduct of water splitting and carbon dioxide reduction processes in artificial photosynthesis \[3, 5, 18\]. Ideally, it would be the only byproduct, ensuring a clean and environmentally friendly process \[1\].

3. Additional Considerations:

‚ó¶ Catalysts: The development of new catalysts is key to artificial photosynthesis. Catalysts are needed to oxidize water and to absorb and reduce carbon dioxide \[11\]. When the catalysts are coupled with materials that can absorb light energy, efficient generation of fuels such as methanol become possible \[11\].

‚ó¶ Photoelectrochemical Cells: Photoelectrochemical cells are essential components of artificial photosynthesis systems, directly converting solar energy into chemical energy \[12\]. These cells consist of a light-absorbing material, catalysts, and redox mediators that facilitate the conversion of absorbed photons into chemical reactions, such as water splitting and carbon dioxide reduction \[12\].

‚ó¶ Redox Mediators: Redox mediators facilitate the electron transfer process in photochemical cells, shuttling electrons between the photosensitizer and the catalysts \[19, 20\]. They minimize energy loss during electron transfer and prevent charge recombination \[19, 20\].

By optimizing these inputs, outputs, and processes, artificial photosynthesis holds significant promise for providing a sustainable energy future \[21\].

## Artificial Photosynthesis: Efficiency and Technological Challenges

Artificial photosynthesis, while promising, currently lags behind natural photosynthesis and other renewable energy technologies in terms of efficiency and economic viability \[1, 2\]. However, it holds the potential to surpass them with further development \[1, 3\].

Efficiency Compared to Natural Photosynthesis:

‚Ä¢ Natural Photosynthesis: Natural photosynthesis, honed by billions of years of evolution, achieves an efficiency of approximately 3‚Äì6% in converting sunlight into stored chemical energy \[2, 4\].

‚Ä¢ Artificial Photosynthesis: Artificial systems currently struggle to reach similar efficiencies at a comparable cost \[2, 4\]. While some artificial photosynthesis lab prototypes have reported efficiencies as high as 22.4% \[5\], these are not yet commercially viable \[1\].

‚Ä¢ Theoretical vs. Actual Efficiency: Photosynthetic organisms can collect about 50% of incident solar radiation, however the theoretical limit of photosynthetic efficiency is 4.6 and 6.0% for C3 and C4 plants respectively \[5\]. In reality, the efficiency of photosynthesis is much lower and is usually below 1%, with some exceptions such as sugarcane in tropical climate \[5\].

‚Ä¢ Exceeding Natural Photosynthesis: Researchers have developed hybrid water-splitting biosynthetic systems that consume produced hydrogen to synthesize biomass and fuels/chemicals from low concentrations of CO2, with efficiencies of approximately 50%, which the authors claim exceeds the efficiency of natural photosynthetic processes \[6, 7\].

Efficiency Compared to Other Renewable Energy Technologies:

‚Ä¢ Photovoltaic Cells: Some solar cells are reportedly approximately ten times more efficient than natural photosynthesis \[8\]. However, solar energy converted into electricity using photovoltaic cells must then be converted again into chemical energy for storage, which results in energy losses \[1\].

‚Ä¢ Artificial Leaf: One startup stated that its "artificial leaf" prototype offered few savings compared to other methods of producing hydrogen from sunlight, and they would not be scaling it up \[8\].

Factors Affecting Efficiency in Artificial Photosynthesis:

‚Ä¢ Light Absorption: Enhancing the performance of photochemical cells can be achieved by broadening their absorption spectra, which allows them to capture more sunlight and convert it into useful energy \[9\]. This can be done by designing novel photosensitizers, employing multiple photosensitizers with complementary absorption spectra, or introducing additional light-harvesting materials \[9\].

‚Ä¢ Charge Separation: Efficient charge separation is essential for converting absorbed light energy into chemical energy and preventing energy loss from the recombination of generated charges \[10\].

‚Ä¢ Catalysis: The technology to catalyze reactions at a reasonable cost and with a high level of efficiency is still in development \[11\].

‚Ä¢ CO2 Conversion: The reduction of CO2 presents challenges such as thermodynamic stability and high reduction potential, which necessitate a substantial energy input to transform it into useful compounds \[12\].

‚Ä¢ Material Stability and Cost: The durability and stability of photochemical cells, as well as the cost and resource efficiency of artificial photosynthesis technologies, are significant challenges that must be addressed for widespread implementation \[13-15\].

Despite the current challenges, artificial photosynthesis is still considered a potential game-changer because of its promise in creating a sustainable, carbon-neutral energy source \[1, 3, 16\].

## Catalysts in Artificial Photosynthesis: Types, Roles, and Development

Catalysts play a crucial role in artificial photosynthesis by facilitating the chemical reactions that convert solar energy into chemical energy \[1\]. They are essential for both water oxidation and carbon dioxide reduction, enabling the production of fuels and valuable chemicals \[2\]. The development of efficient and stable catalysts is a key focus in advancing artificial photosynthesis technologies \[3\].

Here's a detailed explanation of the role of catalysts and some promising types being developed:

Role of Catalysts in Artificial Photosynthesis

1. Facilitating Redox Reactions: Catalysts facilitate redox reactions that convert solar energy into chemical energy \[4\]. These reactions involve the transfer of electrons between molecules, which is essential for both water oxidation and carbon dioxide reduction \[5\].

2. Water Oxidation (Oxygen Evolution Reaction, OER): In water oxidation, catalysts help oxidize water molecules to produce oxygen gas and protons \[2\]. This reaction is also known as the oxygen-evolving reaction (OER) \[2\].

3. Carbon Dioxide Reduction (CO2RR): In carbon dioxide reduction, catalysts reduce CO2 to produce value-added chemicals and fuels, such as carbon monoxide, formic acid, methanol, or methane \[2\]. This reaction is also known as the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) \[2\].

4. Enhancing Efficiency and Selectivity: Catalysts enhance the efficiency and selectivity of these reactions, ensuring that the desired products are formed with minimal energy input and maximum yield \[1\].

5. Lowering Overpotential: Efficient catalysts reduce the overall overpotential of the system, improving its efficiency \[6\].

Types of Catalysts Being Developed

1. Homogeneous Catalysts: These catalysts are molecularly dissolved in the same phase as the reactants \[1\]. Transition metal complexes, such as cobalt (Co), manganese (Mn), and iron-based complexes, are examples of molecular catalysts used in artificial photosynthesis \[4\]. These catalysts offer cost-effectiveness and sustainability compared to noble metal catalysts \[4\]. A study reported simultaneous H2 and O2 evolution by CdS nanorods decorated with nanoparticulate reduction and molecular oxidation co-catalysts \[4\].

2. Heterogeneous Catalysts: These catalysts exist in a different phase from the reactants, typically as solid materials \[1\]. Nanostructured catalysts, such as metal oxides, metal sulfides, and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), have been explored for artificial photosynthesis applications \[7\]. Examples include cobalt oxide (Co3O4), nickel oxide (NiO), and iron sulfide (FeS2) \[7\]. Pyrite (FeS2)-decorated TiO2 nanotubes have shown higher photocurrent density compared to pure TiO2 nanotubes, attributed to the homogenous integration of FeS2 that increases charge separation \[7\].

3. Biocatalysts: Biocatalysts are enzymes or biological systems that facilitate the conversion of solar energy into chemical energy \[1\]. Enzymes often outperform synthetic catalysts in terms of selectivity, rate, and energy efficiency, particularly in complex chemical transformations under mild aqueous conditions \[8\]. Formate dehydrogenase, formaldehyde dehydrogenase, and alcohol dehydrogenase are examples of enzymes used for CO2 reduction to methanol \[9\].

4. Molecular Catalysts: Molecular catalysts can facilitate a redox reaction that converts solar energy into chemical energy \[4\]. Metal complexes that coordinate with conjugated ligands exhibit improved electrocatalytic properties for CO2 reduction \[10\]. Catalysts based on metal-containing phthalocyanines or porphyrins have demonstrated considerable efficacy for this process \[10\].

5. Bimetallic Catalysts: Bimetallic catalysts have gained interest due to their potential for improved catalytic activity and stability compared to monometallic counterparts \[11\]. These catalysts often exhibit synergistic effects, where the combination of two metals results in enhanced performance compared to the individual metals alone \[11\]. A bimetallic NiFe-based alloy for oxygen evolution in a photochemical water-splitting system demonstrated improved catalytic activity and stability compared to monometallic Ni and Fe catalysts \[11\].

Functions of Specific Catalysts

‚Ä¢ Transition Metal Complexes (Co, Mn, Fe): These complexes facilitate redox reactions, enabling water oxidation and carbon dioxide reduction \[4\]. They offer a balance of cost-effectiveness and sustainability, though their activity and stability may lag behind noble metal catalysts \[4\].

‚Ä¢ Metal Oxides (Co3O4, NiO): Metal oxides provide a high surface area and tunable electronic properties, making them attractive for catalytic applications \[7\]. They are often less expensive than noble metal catalysts but may also have lower activity and stability \[7\].

‚Ä¢ Metal Sulfides (FeS2): Metal sulfides, such as iron pyrite (FeS2), enhance charge separation and interact intensively with substrates like TiO2 nanotubes, resulting in excellent photoelectrochemical activity \[7\].

‚Ä¢ Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs): MOFs offer a high surface area and tunable electronic properties, making them attractive candidates for catalytic applications \[7\].

‚Ä¢ Cobalt-Based Catalysts: Cobalt bipyridine and cobalt phenanthroline complexes are used as redox mediators due to their favorable redox properties and stability \[6\]. They efficiently shuttle electrons between the photoanode and the counter electrode, reducing the overall overpotential of the system \[6\].

‚Ä¢ Copper-Based Catalysts: Copper phenanthroline and copper bipyridine complexes are explored as alternatives to cobalt-based mediators, offering lower cost and abundant availability \[6\].

‚Ä¢ Enzymes (Formate Dehydrogenase, etc.): Enzymes are used for CO2 reduction because of their high turnover and selectivity at minimal overpotential \[9\]. They can be co-immobilized with carbonic anhydrase to enhance the kinetics of CO2 hydration, improving enzymatic CO2 reduction by reducing local pH changes \[9\].

Strategies for Enhancing Catalytic Activity and Stability

1. Co-catalysts: Co-catalysts work in synergy with a primary catalyst, promoting the desired reaction and improving the overall performance of the system \[12\]. For instance, the introduction of co-catalysts such as Pt, Au, or Pd in semiconductor photocatalysts has been shown to improve the efficiency of photocatalytic water splitting \[12\].

2. Surface Modification: Modifying the catalyst surface by introducing functional groups or molecules can alter its electronic properties and promote the desired reactions \[13\]. Surface modification can also improve the stability of catalysts by providing a protective layer against degradation \[13\].

3. Bimetallic Catalysts: Using bimetallic catalysts can lead to synergistic effects, enhancing catalytic activity and stability compared to individual metals \[11\].

4. Biomimetic Models Anchored onto Heterogeneous Supports: Anchoring biomimetic models onto heterogeneous supports, such as metal‚Äìorganic frameworks (MOFs) and silica-based materials, can emulate the structure and function of natural photosynthetic centers \[14\].

## Photoelectrochemical Cells: Function, Materials, and Performance Enhancement

Photoelectrochemical cells (PECs) are essential components of artificial photosynthesis systems, designed to directly convert solar energy into chemical energy \[1\]. They function by mimicking the natural photosynthetic process, using sunlight to drive chemical reactions, most notably water splitting and carbon dioxide reduction \[2\].

Functioning of Photoelectrochemical Cells

1. Light Absorption: The process begins with the absorption of light by a photosensitizer \[3\]. The photosensitizer is a light-absorbing material that generates excited electrons upon illumination \[3, 4\]. These photosensitizers can be organic dyes, inorganic dyes, or quantum dots, each having unique light absorption characteristics \[3, 4\]. The efficiency of the photosensitizer depends on its ability to absorb a broad range of the solar spectrum and the excited state lifetime, which influences the charge separation process \[3, 4\].

2. Charge Separation: Upon light absorption, excited electrons are transferred from the photosensitizer to a suitable electron acceptor, while the resulting positive charges (holes) are transferred to an electron donor \[5, 6\]. This charge separation is crucial for converting absorbed light energy into chemical energy and preventing rapid charge recombination, which would lead to energy loss \[5, 6\].

3. Redox Mediation: Electron transfer in photochemical cells is facilitated by redox mediators, which shuttle electrons between the photosensitizer and the catalysts \[7, 8\]. Redox mediators, which can be metal complexes or organic molecules, minimize energy loss during electron transfer and prevent charge recombination \[7, 8\]. They can also affect the selectivity of the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) by controlling the potential and the number of electrons transferred to the CO2 molecule \[7, 8\].

4. Water Oxidation and Carbon Dioxide Reduction: The separated charges drive two critical reactions:

‚ó¶ Water Oxidation (Oxygen Evolution Reaction, OER): Holes oxidize water molecules to produce oxygen gas and protons \[9\].

‚ó¶ Carbon Dioxide Reduction (CO2RR): Excited electrons reduce CO2 to produce value-added chemicals and fuels like carbon monoxide, formic acid, methanol, or methane \[9\]. The performance of a photochemical cell in these reactions is determined by the activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalysts used for water oxidation and CO2 reduction \[9\].

5. Product Formation: The final step involves the formation of desired products such as hydrogen gas, value-added chemicals, or fuels \[8, 9\]. The distribution of products is determined by the thermodynamics and kinetics of the catalytic reactions, as well as the local concentration of reactants and products \[8, 9\].

6. Configurations: Depending on the type of electrodes used in PEC cells, different photoreactor configurations can be distinguished \[10\]:

‚ó¶ Dark anode/photocathode system \[10, 11\].

‚ó¶ Molecular Catalysts: Transition metal complexes like cobalt (Co), manganese (Mn), and iron-based complexes are utilized \[14\]. While cost-effective and sustainable compared to noble metal catalysts, their activity and stability often need improvement \[14\]. For example, CdS nanorods decorated with nanoparticulate reduction and molecular oxidation co-catalysts can achieve simultaneous hydrogen and oxygen evolution \[14\].

‚ó¶ Nanostructured Catalysts: Metal oxides, metal sulfides, and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) offer high surface area and tunable electronic properties \[15\]. Examples include cobalt oxide (Co3O4), nickel oxide (NiO), and iron sulfide (FeS2) \[15\]. For instance, Pyrite (FeS2)-decorated TiO2 nanotubes have shown enhanced photoelectrochemical water splitting activity \[15\].

3. Electron Mediators (Redox Mediators):

‚ó¶ Cobalt-Based Mediators: Cobalt bipyridine and cobalt phenanthroline complexes are used because of their favorable redox properties and stability \[16\]. However, they can suffer from high recombination rates and limited diffusion coefficients \[16\].

‚ó¶ Copper-Based Mediators: Copper phenanthroline and copper bipyridine complexes are alternatives to cobalt-based mediators, offering lower cost and abundant availability \[16\].

‚ó¶ Organic Redox Mediators: Organic molecules containing viologen, TEMPO, and ferrocene moieties offer low cost, good solubility, and tunable redox properties, but their long-term stability and compatibility remain challenges \[17\].

4. Semiconductor Materials:

‚ó¶ Titanium Dioxide (TiO2): Due to its low cost, low toxicity, and ease of preparation, TiO2 is frequently used as a photoanode, though it has limitations for practical use in PEC systems \[18\].

‚ó¶ Silicon-Based Materials: Silicon-based mesoporous materials are used because of their semiconductor properties, high surface area, and controllable pore size \[19\]. Nanostructured silicon possesses direct band gaps that facilitate efficient charge transfers \[19\].

For example, using a 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) self-assembled monolayer (SAM) to modify the SnO2 electron selective layer (ESL)‚Äìperovskite layer interface can improve perovskite film quality and reduce recombination \[20\].

‚Ä¢ Nanostructured Materials: Employing nanostructured materials increases surface area and provides short pathways for charge transport, reducing recombination losses \[21\].

‚Ä¢ Novel Materials and Architectures: Research into perovskite materials, two-dimensional materials, and metal‚Äìorganic frameworks shows potential for enhancing light absorption, charge transport, and catalytic activity \[22\].

Challenges and Opportunities

‚Ä¢ Photosystem I (PSI): PSI and hydrogenase can be assembled to achieve the efficient conversion of solar energy into hydrogen \[6\].

‚Ä¢ Chimeric Polypeptide: A novel chimeric polypeptide consisting of PSI and a hydrogenase enzyme can be used \[7, 8\]. This chimera utilizes the endogenous hydrogenase of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which is more abundant and physiologically active \[8\]. When expressed in a C. reinhardtii strain devoid of native hydrogenases, the chimera successfully formed active PSI‚Äìhydrogenase complexes, capable of repairing itself in vivo, and was able to power the Calvin‚ÄìBenson‚ÄìBassham cycle, resulting in high rates of O2 production \[8\].

‚Ä¢ Photosystem I (PSI) protein complexes: Schuhmann et al. fabricated a photocathode by immobilizing photosystem I (PSI) protein complexes in a dense and anisotropic structure that promoted efficient unidirectional electron flow \[9\]. The use of redox polymers facilitated electron transfer and prevented short-circuiting processes \[9\].

## The Oxygen Evolution Reaction: Fundamentals and Applications

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a crucial half-reaction in water splitting that involves the four-electron oxidation of water to produce oxygen \[1\]. The reaction can be summarized as follows \[1\]:

$2H\_2O \\rightarrow O\_2 + 4H^+ + 4e^-$ \[1\]

OER is inherently more complex and energetically demanding than the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) because of its multi-electron nature \[1\]. The need for four protons and four electrons in OER significantly contributes to its kinetic sluggishness and high overpotential \[1\].

Importance of OER:

1. Water Splitting OER is essential in the process of water splitting, where water molecules are split into hydrogen and oxygen using sunlight \[2, 3\]. Water splitting is crucial for producing hydrogen fuel and other value-added products using renewable energy sources \[2, 3\].

2. Artificial Photosynthesis OER is one of the two critical reactions that drive artificial photosynthesis \[4\]. In artificial photosynthesis, OER uses holes generated during the charge separation process to oxidize water molecules, producing oxygen gas and protons \[4\]. Photoelectrochemical cells (PECs) that perform OERs are a promising avenue for sustainable energy production and carbon management \[5\].

3. Understanding Reaction Steps Understanding the key intermediate states and reaction steps of OERs is vital to designing and optimizing efficient OER catalysts for artificial photosynthesis \[1\]. OER generally proceeds via the "OER cycle," which involves the formation and deprotonation of various hydroxylated intermediates on the catalyst surface \[1\].

4. Catalyst Surface Interactions The interactions between the catalyst surface and the OER intermediates play a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity of OER \[6\]. These interactions can be quantified in terms of the adsorption energies of the intermediates, which significantly influence the reaction barriers and rate-determining step \[6\].

5. Charge Transfer and Transport The kinetics of OER can be significantly affected by the rate of charge transfer and transport on the catalyst surface \[7\]. Nanostructuring can improve these processes by reducing the length scales for charge transport and by optimizing the catalyst‚Äôs electronic structure \[7\].

6. Synergistic Effects Heterogeneous and hybrid catalysts can exploit synergistic effects between different materials to improve OER performance \[8\]. For instance, hybrid catalysts composed of a transition metal oxide and a conductive carbon material can benefit from the high OER activity of the metal oxide and the excellent conductivity of the carbon material \[8\].

7. Interface Engineering The design and optimization of the interfaces between different materials in a heterogeneous or hybrid catalyst are crucial for maximizing their OER performance \[9, 10\]. Proper interface engineering can enhance charge transfer rates across the interface, stabilize the catalyst structure, and even create additional active sites for OERs \[9, 10\].

## CO2 Reduction: Challenges and Strategies for Sustainable Conversion

Managing multi-electron and multi-proton transfers in CO2 reduction presents significant challenges due to the complexity of the reaction mechanisms and the multiple potential reaction pathways \[1\]. These challenges are critical to address for the efficient and selective conversion of CO2 into valuable products \[1\].

Challenges in managing multi-electron and multi-proton transfers in CO2 reduction:

‚Ä¢ Thermodynamic Stability and High Reduction Potential: CO2 is thermodynamically stable and has a high reduction potential, necessitating substantial energy input to transform it into useful compounds \[1\].

‚Ä¢ Complex Reaction Mechanisms: The CO2 reduction process involves multi-electron and multi-proton transfers, which, if improperly managed, can lead to a variety of products, decreasing selectivity and efficiency \[1\].

‚Ä¢ Catalyst Development: The development of catalysts that can selectively direct CO2 towards specific products poses a major challenge because of the numerous potential reaction pathways \[1\].

‚Ä¢ Competition with Water Molecules: Under ambient temperature and pressure conditions, the solubility of CO2 in water is low, causing it to perform poorly when competing with water molecules during the adsorption process \[2\]. The low diffusion rate and solubility of CO2 in aqueous solutions greatly limit the efficiency of CO2 conversion \[2\].

‚Ä¢ Breaking C-O Bonds: CO2 is a nonpolar linear molecule with two strong bonds, which necessitates a high use of energy to break the C-O bonds, resulting in low conversion rates \[2\].

To address these challenges, various strategies and approaches are being explored:

‚Ä¢ Electrocatalysis: Electrocatalysis has gained extensive attention because of its benefits, including mild reaction conditions, flexible product adjustment, low yields of byproducts, and the utilization of renewable energy sources \[3, 4\]. The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to chemicals is viewed as a sustainable method to combat global warming while promoting economic growth \[3, 4\]. Achieving cost-competitive CO2 electrolysis necessitates meeting specific criteria, such as a high current density, high selectivity, and long-term operation \[5, 6\].

‚Ä¢ Photocatalysis: Photocatalytic CO2 reduction processes, based on an artificial photosynthetic scheme, necessitate the involvement of a photosensitizer that captures sunlight and delivers a high-energy electron to a catalytic center, being ultimately responsible for CO2 reduction \[7\].

‚Ä¢ Photoelectrochemical (PEC) Approach: PEC combines the advantages of electrocatalytic and photocatalytic approaches while improving the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron‚Äìhole pairs \[8-10\].

‚Ä¢ Biocatalytic Approach: The natural conversion of atmospheric CO2 into organic compounds via the Calvin cycle during the process of photosynthesis is known as carbon fixation, which occurs in plants, algae, and some bacteria \[11, 12\]. These enzymatically controlled processes are distinguished by their exceptional selectivity and specificity, as well as their remarkable efficiency and mild operational parameters \[11, 12\].

‚Ä¢ Biomimetic Approaches: By mimicking the natural Calvin cycle and the structure and function of active sites in enzymes, researchers are developing catalytic systems to reduce CO2 into usable fuels and valuable chemicals and improve the selectivity of the process \[1, 13\].

‚Ä¢ Use of Metal Complexes: Metal complexes that coordinate with conjugated ligands exhibit improved electrocatalytic properties capable of carrying out CO2 reduction \[14\]. To this end, catalysts based on metal-containing phthalocyanines or porphyrins have been developed, which have demonstrated considerable efficacy for this process \[14\].

‚Ä¢ Exploiting Local Electric Fields: High-local electric fields, which lead to a higher local concentration of CO2 near the active CO2 reduction reaction surface at low applied overpotentials, are generated by nanostructured electrodes \[6\].

Continued research and development efforts are essential to overcome these challenges and realize the full potential of CO2 reduction as a sustainable energy and carbon management strategy \[1\].

## Spatial Separation for Efficient Photocatalytic Water Splitting

Spatial separation of reduction and oxidation sites in photocatalytic water splitting improves efficiency by preventing charge recombination and facilitating the independent optimization of each half-reaction \[1-3\].

The benefits of spatial separation:

‚Ä¢ Preventing Charge Recombination: When reduction and oxidation occur in close proximity, photogenerated electrons and holes can recombine, leading to energy loss. Spatial separation minimizes this by physically separating the sites where hydrogen and oxygen evolution occur, thus increasing the overall quantum efficiency of the water-splitting process \[1, 2\].

‚Ä¢ Optimizing Catalytic Activity: Separating reduction and oxidation sites enables the use of different catalysts tailored to each specific reaction. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) have different requirements for optimal catalytic activity. For example, Wolff and group \[2\] reported simultaneous H2 and O2 evolution by using CdS nanorods decorated with nanoparticulate reduction and molecular oxidation co-catalysts, where hydrogen was generated on Pt nanoparticles at the nanorod tips, and Ru(tpy)(bpy)Cl2-based oxidation catalysts were anchored onto the sides of the nanorod through dithiocarbamate bonds. This spatial separation, achieved through the nanorod morphology of CdS, allowed the process to proceed without sacrificial agents.

‚Ä¢ Enhancing Product Separation: Spatial separation simplifies the separation of hydrogen and oxygen gases, preventing the formation of explosive mixtures. In homogeneous systems, hydrogen and oxygen are produced in the same location, which can be a drawback because of the need for gas product separation \[4\]. Heterogeneous systems, with separate electrodes for the anode and cathode, enable the separation of oxygen and hydrogen production \[4\].

Strategies for achieving spatial separation:

‚Ä¢ Z-scheme photocatalysis: Inspired by natural photosynthesis, Z-scheme photocatalysis uses two different semiconductor materials, each optimized for either oxidation or reduction \[5\]. These semiconductors are connected by a redox mediator that facilitates electron transfer from the oxidation photocatalyst to the reduction photocatalyst, enhancing charge separation and overall efficiency \[5, 6\].

‚Ä¢ Core-shell nanostructures: Constructing photocatalysts with core-shell structures can spatially separate the reduction and oxidation sites. For example, a semiconductor core can be coated with a different material that acts as a co-catalyst for either HER or OER, thereby facilitating charge separation and preventing recombination \[2, 7\].

‚Ä¢ Multi-junction semiconductor devices: Visible light water splitting using a one piece multijunction semiconductor device can achieve spatial separation \[8\]. For example, Energy Conversion Devices demonstrated water photolysis into hydrogen and oxygen using a low cost, thin film amorphous silicon multijunction sheet immersed directly in water \[8\]. Hydrogen evolved on the front amorphous silicon surface decorated with various catalysts while oxygen evolved from the back side metal substrate, eliminating the hazard of mixed hydrogen/oxygen gas evolution \[8\].

Overall, the spatial separation of reduction and oxidation sites is a crucial design principle for efficient photocatalytic water splitting, offering improved charge separation, optimized catalytic activity, and simplified product separation \[1-3\].
